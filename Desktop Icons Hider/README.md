# Desktop-Icons

An AHK (AutoHotKey) script that toggles whether desktop icons are shown/hidden.

To toggle whether desktop icons are shown/hidden press *win+alt+d*.

Keys chosen because *win+d* shows the the desktop and *win+ctrl+d* creates a new desktop.
I believe it is necessary to first switch to the desktop before we can hide the icons.

To get this script to work each and every time you start your computer, place the executable in *'..\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp'*. Open run using *Win+R* and open *'shell:common startup'*.
