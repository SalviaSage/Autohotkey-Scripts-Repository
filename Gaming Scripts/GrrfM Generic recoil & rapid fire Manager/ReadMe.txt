	Using tools such as GrrfM is generally frowned upon in the gaming community 
	and in most games it is against their terms.
	While it is extremely unlikely that you'd be banned from using this script, 
	as it doesn't interact with the game at all, it's still possible that it 
	would be detected if the anti-hack will look for running AHK scripts or GrrfM
	in specific.

	When you use this tool you have to acknowledge the possibility that your 
	account and money poured into micro-transactions will go to waste if the 
	unlikely will happen when you get banned!
