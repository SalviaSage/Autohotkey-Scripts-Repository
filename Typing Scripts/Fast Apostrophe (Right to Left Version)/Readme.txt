Fast Apostrophe Right to Left Version;

This program is aimed at people who want to type orthographical marks appropriately.
It keeps the original keys of the keyboard and thus does not break anything but it adds some punctuation marks that are useful for typing languages.
To type these, just hold down the punctuation mark keys for a set amount of time.
It does not change anything of the letters.

This program has been specifically adapted for use with scripts written from right to left.
