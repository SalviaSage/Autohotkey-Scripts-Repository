The correct location to place the zero width no-break space between punctuation marks is at the letters, not at the punctuation marks.

For example;

(PARENTHESIS)(SPACE)(ZWNBS)text(ZWNBS)(SPACE)(PARENTHESIS)

The following is the WRONG example:

(PARENTHESIS)(ZWNBS)(SPACE)text(SPACE)(ZWNBS)(PARENTHESIS)

They have to anchor to text for the no-break operation to work.
I just tested it with the quotation marks and the parentheses.
