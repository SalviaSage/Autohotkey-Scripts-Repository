â€“ Preferably, we want only the character to be held down and not the key.
For example: We want to type the fraction slash. We can type it by holding down the / key on the keyboard.
As it is desired. However, if we press shift + / key and hold it down, we still type the fraction slash.
This key itself, shift + / is the question mark key. So, it shouldn't be based on the key but based on the character.

Currently, it works based on the key. There may be a way to change that.
