Fast Apostrophe (Hair Spaced) (RTL Version);

This program is aimed at people who want to type orthographical marks appropriately.
It keeps the original keys of the keyboard and does not break anything but it adds some punctuation marks that are useful for typing languages.
To type these, just hold down the punctuation mark keys for a set amount of time.
It does not change the letters.

The difference with this one, compared with the regular version is that
this version puts a very narrow space (hairspace) between quotation marks parentheses and brackets.

This program has been specifically adapted for use with scripts written from right to left.
