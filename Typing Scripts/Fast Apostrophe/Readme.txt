Fast Apostrophe;

The idea behind this script is to create a computer program that runs in the background
which gives the typer an easy way to type the apostrophe, the quotation marks, the
ellipsis and other similar punctuation marks. It is intended to be language independent.

Basically, you press a certain similar key twice or thrice in order to get another key.
Most people just make do with what the keyboard has, but if you are a writer it just isn't enough.
