which gives the typer an easy way to type parenthesis, brackets and curly brackets.

;; Hit the '(' key on the keyboard twice to get the '()' keys.
;; Hit the '[' key on the keyboard twice to get the '[]' keys.
;; Hit the '{' key on the keyboard twice to get the '{}' keys.

;; This helps in typing the parentheses fast since they are always used as doubles.
