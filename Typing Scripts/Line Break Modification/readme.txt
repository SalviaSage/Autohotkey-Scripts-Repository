Line-Break Modification;

Addresses the issue in the program "Typora.exe" and "Wordpad.exe" with regards to spacing of line-breaks.

The issue is that there are two ways to make line-breaks in these programs.
One by pressing (Enter) and another by pressing (Shift+Enter).
(Enter) creates a new line with more line-spacing compared with (Shift+Enter).
Clearly, it is supposed to be the other way around, so the program makes it so that the keys are swapped.

It is supposed to be used with the programs "Typora" and "WordPad", the issue does not affect LibreOffice.
