I happened to have this idea pop up in my mind.
It is an easy way to type extra letters by double tapping similar letters.
I was dissatisfied with my earlier idea of pressing shift+key for being too slow.

List: Double tapping 'a' gives us 'á'.
	Double tapping 'e' gives us 'é'.
	Double tapping 'i' gives us 'í'.
	Double tapping 'o' gives us 'ó'.
	Double tapping 'u' gives us 'ú'.
	
	Double tapping 'n' gives us 'ñ'.

It also has capital letters.
For example: Double tapping shift+e gives us 'É'.
             Double tapping shift+n gives us 'Ñ'.

Punctuation marks: Double tapping '?' gives us '¿?'.
			   Double tapping '!' gives us '¡!'.

This version is for Spanish.
