I happened to have this idea pop up in my mind.
It is an easy way to type extra letters by double tapping similar letters.
I was dissatisfied with my earlier idea of pressing shift+key for being too slow.

For example: Double tapping 'o' gives us 'ö'.
             Double tapping 'u' gives us 'ü'.

It also has capital letters.
For example: Double tapping 'O' gives us 'Ö'.
             Double tapping 'U' gives us 'Ü'.

This version is for Turkish.
