I happened to have this idea pop up in my mind.
It is an easy way to type extra letters by double tapping similar letters.
I was dissatisfied with my earlier idea of pressing shift+key for being too slow.

For example: Double tapping 'e' gives us 'é'.
             Double tapping 'n' gives us 'ñ'.

It also has capital letters.
For example: Double tapping 'E' gives us 'É'.
             Double tapping 'N' gives us 'Ñ'.

This version is for Turkish.
