Typer Helper; A revolutionary program for typing letter variations
in various different languages and alphabets.

This program was made to address the problem of not being able to type
various different markings that go on top of and under the letters(diacritics)
in various different languages and alphabets.

Basically, copy and paste the .json file that is inside the 'languages' folder of the language/alphabet that you are interested into
the main program directory. Then launch the program and press F12 and it will give you a menu from where you can select the language
or the alphabet that you are interested in typing.

This program however, does not give you an original way of typing letters.

For example, in the Turkish alphabet, there are the letters 'ş' and 'ç'.
To type these, you would copy the file 'Typer-Turkish-Azeri.json' into the program folder.
Then launch the program and press F12 and select 'Turkish / Azeri' from the dropdown menu.

Then, you hold down the 'c' key for a quarter second and you will get the 'ç' key.
The program relies on other keys that are already there on the keyboard to give us these extra keys.

In order to get a second and other variations, for example, in Hungarian, there are 'o', 'ó', 'ö' and 'ő'.

To get the first variation, we just hold the 'o' key. To get the second one, we tap the 'o' key and hold it down for a quarter second.
Then, we get 'ö', to get 'ő', we tap the 'o' key twice and then hold the key for a quarter second.

This system is revolutionary in the sense that the typer will never type the wrong unwanted key.
Holding the key prevents accidental typing of the unwanted letters.
Furthermore, being able to put many different variations simply by changing the number of times the letter is tapped really helps us here.

One problem and issue that I still want to address is the fact that we can not do this with non-latin letters that are assigned on the keyboard.
It only works with latin alphabet letters, however, we can assign holds to the number keys that are on the top row on the keyboard.
This is exactly what it does with the Greek typer and the Cyrillic typer in order to type some of the diacritics that may be used there.

Similarly, we can easily type the tone diacritics that we are interested in Vietnamese by pressing and holding the 1-5 keys on the keyboard.
For example, we want to type 'ậ'. It is the letter 'a' with a circumflex accent and a dot under it.
First, we press and hold the 'a' key for a quarter second to get the 'â' key, then we press and hold the '5' key on the keyboard.
Then the program adds the dot under the 'â' key.

This program is revolutionary in the sense that it works with many different alphabets and spellings, albeit, it is limited mostly to the Latin alphabet.

The different versions of the .exe is just that one of them requires a quarter of a second to trigger the keys
and the other one requires one third of a second to trigger the keys.
