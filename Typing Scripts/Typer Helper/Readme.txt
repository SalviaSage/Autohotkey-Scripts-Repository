Typer Helper; A revolutionary program for typing letter variations
in various different languages and alphabets.

This program was made to address the problem of not being able to type
various different markings that go on top of and under the letters(diacritics)
in various different languages and alphabets.

Basically, copy and paste the .json file that is inside the 'inactive' folder of the language/alphabet that you are interested into
the main program directory. Then launch the program and press F12 and it will give you a menu from where you can select the language
or the alphabet that you are interested in typing.

This program however, does not give you an original way of typing letters.

For example, in the Turkish alphabet, there are the letters 'ş' and 'ç'.
To type these, you would copy the file 'Typer-Turkish-Azeri.json' into the program folder.
Then launch the program and press F12 and select 'Turkish / Azeri' from the dropdown menu.

Then, you hold down the 'c' key for a quarter second and you will get the 'ç' key.
The program relies on other keys that are already there on the keyboard to give us these extra keys.

In order to get a second and other variations, for example, in Hungarian, there are 'o', 'ó', 'ö' and 'ő'.

To get the first variation, we just hold the 'o' key. To get the second one, we tap the 'o' key and hold it down for a quarter second.
Then, we get 'ö', to get 'ő', we tap the 'o' key twice and then hold the key for a quarter second.

This system is revolutionary in the sense that the typer will never type the wrong unwanted key.
Holding the key prevents accidental typing of the unwanted letters.
Furthermore, being able to put many different variations simply by changing the number of times the letter is tapped really helps us here.

One problem and issue that I still want to address is the fact that we can not do this with non-latin letters that are assigned on the keyboard.
It only works with latin alphabet letters, however, we can assign holds to the number keys that are on the top row on the keyboard.
This is exactly what it does with the Greek typer and the Cyrillic typer in order to type some of the diacritics that may be used there.

Similarly, we can easily type the tone diacritics that we are interested in Vietnamese by pressing and holding the 1-5 keys on the keyboard.
For example, we want to type 'ậ'. It is the letter 'a' with a circumflex accent and a dot under it.
First, we press and hold the 'a' key for a quarter second to get the 'â' key, then we press and hold the '5' key on the keyboard.
Then the program adds the dot under the 'â' key.

This program is revolutionary in the sense that it works with many different alphabets and spellings, albeit, it is limited mostly to the Latin alphabet.

The different versions of the .exe is just that one of them requires a quarter of a second to trigger the keys
and the other one requires one third of a second to trigger the keys.

NOTES ON REGARDING THE TYPING OF THE TITTLE (the dot above the letter i):

VIETNAMESE:
By default, when a diacritic is placed over the letters 'i' and 'j', the dot that is on top of these letters(the tittle)
is replaced by the diacritic. For example, when we add the tilde accent on top of the letter 'i', it becomes 'ĩ'.
However, it may be that the language actually requires keeping the tittle or the typer may desire to type it that way, such as 'i̇̃'
For example, in Vietnamese, we want to write 'bi̇̀nh' instead of 'bình'. In that case, first, we have to add the tittle on top of the letter i or j
with the 'combining dot above (U+0307)' character. This does not change the chracter graphically, so it does not look like 'i̇̇'.
As I mentioned earlier, using any combining diacritic above removes the tittle, but we can preserve it by adding it ourselves.
So, I assigned the backtick key(console key) on the keyboard to the 'combining dot above (U+0307)' character. We can preserve the tittle
by first typing the letter i like normally, then pressing the backtick key to add the tittle on it, then pressing the 1 to 5 number keys on the keyboard
to add the tone diacritics that we want to type. The combining dot above should not be used however, with the last tone, the underdot because it is placed
below the letter and not above it. The combining diaeresis, that is, adding two dots on top of the letter is accessed by pressing the backtick key twice.

TURKISH:
Sometimes, the circumflex accent is used in Turkish to differentiate words based on phonemic vowel length.
For example "hatta" and "hattâ" are two different words with different meanings, the latter having longer vowel length.
This practice itself is useful and should be employed in spelling.
Due to the vowel system of Arabic and the long vowel Arabic words that are present in the Turkish language,
this accent is typically placed over the vowels i, u and a. However, it can be placed on other vowels as well.
As I mentioned earlier with the Vietnamese language, the tittle is removed when we place the circumflex accent on top of the letter 'i'.
This is a problem because there is another letter in Turkish, the dotless i, so it then seems like we placed the accent on the dotless i instead.
For this reason, I strictly recommend keeping the tittle when we use the circumflex accent on this vowel.
For example, the Arabic word "eternal", "bâki̇̂" should be spelled this way.
There may also be words where the dotless i is pronounced long, for example in Ottoman Turkish.
In this scenario, without preserving the tittle, we cannot distinguish them in writing.

Keep in mind that this can fail dictionary searches and searches for words typed in this way.
