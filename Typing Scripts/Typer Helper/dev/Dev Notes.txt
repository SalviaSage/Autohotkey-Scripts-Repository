With regards to typing characters with combining diacritics;

This works as expected.

For example;

"n": ["{U+006E}{U+0304}"]

This gives us the letter n with a macron on top of it.
Normally, this is not a letter of Unicode, but we can still type it simply by placing the codepoint of the combining diacritic
directly next to the subject letter.

HOWEVER, TURNING ON CAPS LOCK DOES NOT GIVE US CAPITAL FORMS OF THESE LETTERS.
THEREFORE, FOR THE NEXT TAP, WE HAVE TO ADD THE CAPITAL FORM OF THE LETTER MANUALLY AS THE COMPUTER DOES NOT AUTOMATE IT FOR US.

With regards to the program not working for non-latin keys;
The problem is that if we are using a non-latin keyboard layout with assigned non-latin keys,
the keys do not work appropriately and or that the program gives an error popup.

I don't know how to make holdables for non-latins at the moment but this is something of interest as it can help the typist type in non-latin alphabets
in an easier way.
