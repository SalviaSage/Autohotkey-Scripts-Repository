With regards to writing precomposed characters with combining diacritics;

This works as expected.

For example;

"n": ["{U+006E}{U+0304}"]

This gives us the letter n with a macron on top of it.
Normally, this is not a letter of Unicode, but we can still type it simply by placing the codepoint of the combining diacritic
directly next to the subject letter.
𝑯𝒐𝒘𝒆𝒗𝒆𝒓, 𝒕𝒖𝒓𝒏𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒐𝒏 𝑪𝒂𝒑𝒔 𝑳𝒐𝒄𝒌,  𝒅𝒐𝒆𝒔 𝒏𝒐𝒕 𝒈𝒊𝒗𝒆𝒔 𝒖𝒔 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝒄𝒂𝒑𝒊𝒕𝒂𝒍 𝒇𝒐𝒓𝒎𝒔 𝒐𝒇 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝒍𝒆𝒕𝒕𝒆𝒓𝒔, 𝒘𝒉𝒆𝒏 𝒖𝒔𝒆𝒅 𝒘𝒊𝒕𝒉 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝒖𝒏𝒊𝒄𝒐𝒅𝒆 𝒄𝒐𝒅𝒆-𝒑𝒐𝒊𝒏𝒕𝒔.


With regards to the program not working for non-latin keys;
The problem is that if we are using a non-latin keyboard with assigned non-latin keys,
the keys do not work appropriately and or that the program gives an error pop-up.
The program does not close simply because we picked a non-latin library, however that library simply does not work.
I don't know how to fix it at this point but this is something of interest as it can help the typist type in non-latin alphabets.
