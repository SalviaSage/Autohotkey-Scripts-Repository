With regards to typing characters with combining diacritics;

This works as expected.

For example;

"n": ["{U+006E}{U+0304}"]

This gives us the letter n with a macron on top of it.
Normally, this is not a letter of Unicode, but we can still type it simply by placing the codepoint of the combining diacritic
directly next to the subject letter.

HOWEVER, TURNING ON CAPS LOCK DOES NOT GIVE US CAPITAL FORMS OF THESE LETTERS.
THEREFORE, FOR THE NEXT TAP, WE HAVE TO ADD THE CAPITAL FORM OF THE LETTER MANUALLY AS THE COMPUTER DOES NOT AUTOMATE IT FOR US.

With regards to the program not working for non-latin keys;
The problem is that if we are using a non-latin keyboard layout with assigned non-latin keys,
the keys do not work appropriately and or that the program gives an error popup.

I tested the program with non-latin alphabet layouts and it does work.
It might give an error in which case, the program can be restarted or the keyboard layouts can be switched for the program to work.

With regards to moving the cursor left or right, the syntax {Left} and {Right} does work.

{Backspace} is the correct way to send the backspace control character. Its Unicode {U+0008} does not work.
