This is a script consisting only of hotstrings.

Basically, you just type the circumflex accent that is already on the default keyboards
after you type the letter. For example:

Press c, then press ^ and you will automatically get:
Ä‰ latin small letter c with circumflex (U+0109)

It is easy because Esperanto only makes extra letters with the use of the circumflex accent.
It was picked as such because it existed on typewriters at the time.
However, the circumflex accent is also there on modern keyboards.
