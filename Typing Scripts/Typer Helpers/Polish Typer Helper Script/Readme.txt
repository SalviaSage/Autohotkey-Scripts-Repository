I happened to have this idea pop up in my mind.
It is an easy way to type extra letters by double tapping similar letters.
I was dissatisfied with my earlier idea of pressing shift+key for being too slow.

POLISH TYPER HELPER SCRIPT:

List: Double tapping 'l' gives us 'ł'.

	Double tapping 'a' gives us 'ą'.
	Double tapping 'e' gives us 'ę'.

	Double tapping 'o' gives us 'ó'.
	Double tapping 'n' gives us 'ń'.
	Double tapping 's' gives us 'ś'.
	Double tapping 'z' gives us 'ź'.

It also has capital letters.

HOTSTRINGS:
	Typing z^. gives us ż.
	Typing Z^. gives us Ż.

This version is for Polish.
