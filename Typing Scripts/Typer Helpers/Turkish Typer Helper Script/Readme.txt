I happened to have this idea pop up in my mind.
It is an easy way to type extra letters by double tapping similar letters.
I was dissatisfied with my earlier idea of pressing shift+key for being too slow.

TURKISH TYPER HELPER SCRIPT:

List: Double tapping 'a' gives us 'â'.
	Double tapping 'e' gives us 'ə'. (For writing Azeri)
	Double tapping 'o' gives us 'ö'.
	Double tapping 'u' gives us 'ü'.
	Double tapping 'g' gives us 'ğ'.
	Double tapping 'c' gives us 'ç'.
	Double tapping 's' gives us 'ş'.
	Double tapping 'i' gives us 'ı'.

	Typing a^ gives us â.
	Typing i^ gives us î.
	Typing u^ gives us û.

It also has capital letters.

For example:
	Double tapping 'O' gives us 'Ö'.
	Double tapping 'U' gives us 'Ü'.

	Typing A^ gives us Â.
	Typing I^ gives us Î.
	Typing U^ gives us Û.

When you write a capital (shift or caps) 'i', it will give you 'İ' correctly, instead of 'I'.

This version is for Turkish.

Cursive version is also included.
Although it does not look very good on the smartphone, it looks okay on the computer.
It tries to substitute what cursive writing would look like with some success.
