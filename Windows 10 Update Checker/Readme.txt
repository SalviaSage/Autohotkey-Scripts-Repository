This program can pop up the number of updates that are available for Windows 10.

I don't know if it will work with other versions of Windows.

It also makes a .txt file on the desktop which lists which updates are available with their names and how many.
But, I commented that part out.

It might find the Microsoft Silverlight as missing, perhaps because that is a legacy update and Windows is not updating it automatically.
That can be installed manually.

It may also find outdated windows defender definitions.

This program can also be considered as a virus by Microsoft Defender because it connects to some external servers.
However, I don't believe it is a virus.
